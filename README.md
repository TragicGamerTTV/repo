## RedX's Repo!
* Help by Zemyoro #shamelessplug (delete after lol)

each time you put a deb in the debs folder, make sure to update the Packages file.
* If you need help getting the MD5 and other stuff just go to: http://onlinemd5.com/
* Once you're there, just click the "Click to select file" part and select the deb
* Each, MD5, SHA1, SHA-256, will have checksums. Just put it in the required fields in
the packages file.

* Once you're done with the packages file, open the terminal and go to the path your repo is in
* Then after that, run sudo ./
